# Robot-Bartender
The Robot Bartender is a project created to have a deeper understanding of lower level networking fundamentals, while also using this as an excuse to understand Android development, and Android networking on a deeper level. 

The Robotic Bartender runs a custom made server developed with Python, and interfaces with Android devices running on Java. An issue found during the development of the project shows that Multicast requests are not able to be received on newer Android versions, even with correct permission settings, forcing a manual connection via direct IP, or the use of POST requests sent via a webserver effectively acting as our API.

Please note that the code posted here is not our final build, as we have decided to keep this private due to financial interests from a third party organization. This being said, we wanted to showcase parts of the project in hopes that we can inspire others. 

## Missing components include:
 - Web Server API Code and Demo
 - Node.JS Code (The project was switched to Node.JS from Flask/Python Server for compatability and performance requirements)
 - Completed Android Application

The code available however, is fully working with Android phones, and has a small drink database populated for testing, and can be used by those looking to build their own version.

## Parts List:
- 12V Power Supply
- 5V Dropdown Voltage Regulator
- x6 Peristaltic Pumps
- x6 Flyback Diodes
- 8 Channel Relay Switch
- Raspberry Pi B+ (Zero would be acceptable)
- Misc. Parts: Wire, Soldering Supplies, LED, lumber, paint, nails, screws, etc.
